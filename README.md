#pyroulette
Basic Console Russian-Roulette game with a monster made on python.

Each of you has 3 lives. The shotgun contains blank and live rounds. They are located in it in an unknown sequence. Your task is to kill the monster (and not die yourself).

PyRoulette was inspired by Mike Klubnika's "Buckshot Roulette" game.
